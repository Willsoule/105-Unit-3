# 105-Unit-3
This is a repository containing instructional materials and sample data sets for Prof. Gotzler's Fall 2022 sections of ENGL-105 at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
The repository contains 3 python notebooks, covering basic topics in coding Python3, and beginner modules on using the pandas package for data analysis.
The materials have been adapated from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the research hub of UNC's Davis Library.


 This data is from the US Government Data Catalog that has archived Covid-19 cases and deaths in each state over time. I was interested in this data because through python3, I was able to code just the Covid-19 data of North Carolina. A state that has great significance to me since it is the state that I was born in and go to school in. This repository data set is intended for North Carolina residents who are interested in how Covid-19 has impacted our state and how we have adapted to Covid over time. This data set is a smaller subcategory of the orginal csv file, which illustrated all of the states and their impact with Covid-19.

This visualization shows the amount of cases recorded in North Carolina per each sumbission date listed in the CSV file. Through this analysis we see that cases have varied through the past two years, but are starting to level out.
